Usage: gaston bundle <options>
compiles your application into a bundle.js and bundle.css

Available options:

-s --source       path to the file being compiled
-o --output       path to directory where result files are going to be saved
-i --index        wether you want to save an index.html in the output directory

Example:
  gaston bundle -s ./index.js -o bundles/ -i

    - will generate the following files:
      ./bundles/index.html
      ./bundles/bundle.js
      ./bundles/bundle.css

Notes:
- code will be compiled with the options present in the gaston section of the package.json
- paths can be absolute or relative to where you're running the command from
- output is optional 
    argument must be a directory and must exist
    you can run gaston bundle without it just to check if there's no compile errors
    does not generate any files as a result if not specified
