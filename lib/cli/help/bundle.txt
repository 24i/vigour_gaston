Usage: gaston bundle <options>
compiles your application into a bundle.js and bundle.css

Available options:

-s --source       path to the file being compiled
-o --output       path to directory where result files are going to be saved
-i --index-path   path of the index.html file you want to save in the output directory
-p --package      path to package.json, to be included in the bundle
-m --source-maps  if specified will include source-maps in your javascript bundle
-g --gaston       if specified, gaston code will be included in the bundle

Example:
  gaston bundle -s ./index.js -o bundles/ -i ./index.html -p ./package.json -m

    - will generate the following files:
      ./bundles/index.html
      ./bundles/bundle.js
      ./bundles/bundle.css
    - the package.json will be available in your code
    - bundle.js will include sourcemaps at the end

Notes:
- paths can be absolute or relative to where you're running the command from
- output is optional 
    argument must be a directory and must exist
    you can run gaston bundle without it just to check if there's no compile errors
    does not generate any files as a result if not specified
- index-path is optional and 
    it is only accounted for if output is specified
    it should have a script tag pointing to "bundle.js"
    it should have a link tag pointing to "bundle.css"
- package if specified 
    will be available anywhere in your code with "var pkg = require('package.json')"
