Usage: gaston bundle <options>
compiles and minimizes your application into a build.js and build.css

Available options:

-s --source       path to the file being compiled
-o --output       path to directory where result files are going to be saved
-i --index-path   path of the index.html file you want to save in the output directory
-p --package      path to package.json, to be included in the bundle

Example:
  gaston build -s ./index.js -o builds/ -i ./index.html -p ./package.json

    - will generate the following files:
      ./builds/build.html
      ./builds/build.js
      ./builds/build.css
    - the package.json will be available in your code

Notes:
- paths can be absolute or relative to where you're running the command from
- output is optional 
    argument must be a directory and must exist
    you can run gaston build without it just to check if there's no compile errors
    does not generate any files as a result if not specified
- index-path is optional and 
    it is only accounted for if output is specified
    it should have a script tag pointing to "bundle.js"
    it should have a link tag pointing to "bundle.css"
    compilation will replace the references to bundle.* to build.*
- package if specified 
    will be available anywhere in your code with "var pkg = require('package.json')"
