Gaston - app runner
- starts a server on the root of the project

usage: gaston dev [options]

options:
  
  -p, --port : the port express server runs
  -s, --socket-port : the port used for socket communication (auto-reload, etc)
  -j, --no-package : no exposing package.json to the browser window
  -r, --no-auto-reload : no auto-reload when watcher recompiles

* these and other options can be configured in the gaston section in package.json
* can be run in the root of the project directory or in any subdirectory
* will compile the project root, if there's an app there
  - if not, it serves you a directory-index until you reach an app
* if you want to run multiple apps, you need multiple gaston running
  - the ports of the server will be managed automatically so they don't clash
