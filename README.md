gaston
======

Gaston is your favorite handyman, carriying Vigour's evergrowing set of devtools.

(*note: Vigour currently uses browserify and less. Gaston likes this)

## Commands

```gulp compile``` Compiles all js, less and css files into bundle.js and bundle.css. Gaston keeps watching for changes.

```gulp compile-js``` Compiles all js files into bundle.js. Gaston keeps watching for changes.

```gulp compile-less``` Compiles all less and css files into bundle.css. Gaston keeps watching for changes.

```gulp webserver``` Starts a localhost server on :8080.

```gulp``` Performs all of the above.

## Todo

- Replace gulp with custom gaston command. Make available from npm and usable globally.
- Add parameters for all commands.
